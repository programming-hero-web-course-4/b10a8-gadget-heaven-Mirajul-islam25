## 📚 React Fundamentals Used

#  React Hooks :
 Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and allow functional components to manage state, side effects, and context without needing to use class components.

 # Rendering Lists :
React makes it easy to render lists of data by using the map() function to iterate over an array and return components for each item.

# Event Handling :
React handles events like clicks, form submissions, and key presses. React’s event system is similar to DOM events, but with some differences.

# Components : 
React applications are built with components. A component is a JavaScript function (or class) that returns UI elements. Components can be thought of as building blocks of a React app.

# Props (Properties) :
Props are inputs to a React component. They allow you to pass data from a parent component to a child component.


## 🗃️ Data Management
# Context API :
The Context API in React is a powerful feature that allows you to share data across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. This is especially useful when you have global data, such as user authentication status, themes, language preferences, etc.

# Local Storage :
Local Storage is a part of the Web Storage API that allows websites to store data on the client's browser in a key-value format. It’s a simple way to persist data across page reloads and sessions.

## 🚀 Key Features : 

# useState Hook
# react-toastify
